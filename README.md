# Visitor-counter-app
Url hit counter measures and displays the number of times visitors have viewed a single page on a website. 
Hit counters are typically displayed on homepages. Hit counters can be public or non-public. 
If they are non-public, or 'invisible', only the webmaster can see how many times the page has been viewed.
